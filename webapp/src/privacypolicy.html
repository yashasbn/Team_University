    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">I. General Statement</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      PRIVACY is a word that conjures up strong convictions and an emotional reaction from many of us. In the modern
      world, however, wondrous forms of electronic communication render the protection of privacy interests much more
      difficult. We in the university community are not immune from the lure of convenience and speed when we utilize our
      information technology and electronic communication tools. It is, of course, part of our mission to share knowledge
      and to collaborate within our academic community. In doing so, however, we must recognize that these modern devices
      are never completely secure. It is a fact of life that all computer systems and communication systems are the
      subject of constant probing by outsiders ranging from the curious to the criminal.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">II. Personal Information</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The University of Denver recognizes and respects the importance of confidentiality and security of personal
      information in this increasingly open electronic age. The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or
      otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, outside the scope of ordinary University functions, your name, mailing
      address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information you provide. While the University makes reasonable
      efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that this information will remain secure and are
      not responsible for any loss or theft.
    </p>

    <!-- More sections can be added here -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">III. Release or Access</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      All requests for release of or access to confidential information maintained in the records of the University must
      be directed to the office of the University's Legal Counsel. Disposition of such requests will be made by the
      University's Legal Counsel in consultation with the appropriate custodian of the particular University record(s).
